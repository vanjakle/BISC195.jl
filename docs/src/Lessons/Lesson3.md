## Learning objectives

**Concepts** - After completing this lesson, students will be able to:

- Distinguish fruitful functions from void functions
- Recognize boolean values and conditional statments
- Recognize errors resulting resulting from functions expecting boolean values

**Skills** - After completing this lesson, students will be able to:

- Write boolean functions to check the properties of numerical values
- Use alternative evaluation execute different funuctions depending on input
- Recognize recursive functions,
  and identify situations in which they might be useful

**Assignments** - This lesson is complete when students have:

- Read [Chapter 5](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html#chap05)
  and [Chapter 6](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html#chap0)
  of Think Julia.
- Cloned the Assignment 3 repository with github classroom.
- Completed assignment 3 with all tests passing.
- Run all code examples from Lesson 2 on their own computers
